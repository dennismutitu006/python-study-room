The logger methods are named after the level or severity of the events they are used to track. The standard levels and their applicability are described below (in increasing order of severity):

Level

When it’s used

DEBUG

Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

INFO

Confirmation that things are working as expected.

WARNING

An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.

ERROR

Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.

CRITICAL

A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

The default level is WARNING, which means that only events of this level and above will be tracked, unless the logging package is configured to do otherwise.

Events that are tracked can be handled in different ways. The simplest way of handling tracked events is to print them to the console. Another common way is to write them to a disk file.
